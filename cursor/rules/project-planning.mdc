# Project Planning Procedure

## Overview

When creating project documentation and task breakdowns, follow this structured approach to ensure comprehensive planning and execution.

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Surface-Level Description

First, provide a high-level overview of all major steps required for the finished product. This should be:

- **Broad strokes**: Focus on main phases/milestones
- **Sequential**: Present steps in logical order
- **Goal-oriented**: Each step should have a clear deliverable
- **Manageable**: 5-10 major steps maximum

### 2. Detailed Task Breakdown

For each surface-level step, create detailed subtasks that include:

- **Granular actions**: Break down into specific, actionable items
- **Implementation details**: Technical specifics and requirements
- **Check points**: Clear criteria for completion/validation
- **Dependencies**: What must be completed before this task
- **Stopping points**: Natural breakpoints for review and validation

### 3. Implementation Guidelines

Each subtask should:

- Be completable in a single focused session
- Have clear success criteria
- Include validation/testing steps
- Stop after each check/implementation for review
- Allow for iterative feedback and adjustment

## Documentation Format

Use markdown with:

- Clear hierarchical structure (H1 for major steps, H2 for subtasks)
- Numbered lists for sequential tasks
- Checkboxes for actionable items
- Code blocks for technical specifications
- Clear separation between planning and implementation phases

## Quality Standards

Every project plan should:

- Be immediately actionable
- Include all necessary context
- Account for testing and validation
- Consider error handling and edge cases
- Plan for user feedback integration
- Include deployment and maintenance considerations
