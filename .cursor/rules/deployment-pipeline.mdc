# Deployment Pipeline Rule

- **You MUST create and maintain GitHub Actions pipelines to enable deployment to GitHub Pages.**
- **Pipelines must be configured to build and deploy the project automatically on push to the main branch (or as appropriate).**
- **Before pushing any changes, you MUST run all tests to ensure the pipeline will succeed.**
- **If tests fail, do not push until they are fixed.**
- **Pipelines should include steps for install, build, test, and deploy.**
- **Review pipeline logs after each push to confirm successful deployment.**
