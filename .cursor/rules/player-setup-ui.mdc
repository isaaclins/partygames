# Player Setup UI Rule

- The player setup screen MUST use only [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs) components.
- The design MUST be clean, minimalistic, and accessible.
- No other UI libraries or custom component libraries are allowed.
- Use shadcn/ui forms, inputs, buttons, and lists as needed.
- Prioritize clarity, ease of use, and privacy reminders where appropriate.
- Reference [shadcn/ui documentation](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs) and [web examples](https://ui.shadcn.com/r) for best practices.
